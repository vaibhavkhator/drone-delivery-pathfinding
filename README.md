# 🚁 Drone Delivery Pathfinding Simulation

This is a Python simulation of a drone delivery system using the A* pathfinding algorithm, built with **Pygame**. It allows you to set a start point, an end point, and place obstacles on a grid. The drone then finds the optimal path and animates its movement to the destination.

## 🎮 Features

- Interactive grid where you can:
  - Set **Start** and **End** points.
  - Place or remove **Obstacles**.
- **A\*** (A-Star) algorithm for pathfinding.
- Smooth **animated drone movement** along the path.
- **Completion animation** after successful delivery.
- Simple and clean UI with clickable buttons.
